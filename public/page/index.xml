      <description>Fun facts  I don&amp;rsquo;t like coffee (my wife LOVES IT though) I have literally herded cats I dj 😎 I LOVE learning and exploring new concepts and ideas and bringing them to life.  Origin story I pretty much knew I wanted to be a scientist since the age of 5. The declaration came while in Yosemite. My Mom and her best friend were getting ready for a wedding.</description>
