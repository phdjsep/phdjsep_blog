      <description>Background Footgolf is a new sport and there are a lot of things that are still being figured out. One such item is that courses aren’t rated like they are in golf. Rating requires a whole new level of experience that the sport just doesn’t have a whole lot of yet. Rating a course requires taking into account many different variables like slope, distance, obstacles, etc. You can read about it here from the PGA website.</description>

      <description>Another Major, another analysis…
This time I didn’t have the pleasure of being there, but it was fun to keep up from afar. I’ve pulled data and calculated the course statistics for the tournament. 
Overall Stats Some interesting patterns emerge when calculating all the scores across all rounds.
 Holes 3, 7, 12, and 14 were the most difficult. Three of them were par 3’s and one par 4. Hole 6, 8, 10 were the easiest.</description>

      <description>Introduction The American FootGolf League (AFGL) and River Ridge Golf Course hosted the 2018 U.S. Open in Oxnard, CA on April 26th - 29th. The tournament saw players attend from all over the world for the first major of the FIFG World Tour. The course was very difficult as it was both long (~3600 yds), sloped, fast, and occassionally windy.
I played in the tournament myself, albeit not well, and anecdotally found that certain holes were more troublesome than others, especially depending on time of day (ex, windy).</description>
