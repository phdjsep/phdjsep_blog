      <p>I wanted a local dataset to begin messing around with deep learning (and whatever the next hot technology will be in 6 months lol). Since most of my time is spent on electronic medical record (EMR) data, I decided to set out on finding a free dataset that I could leverage for my experimentations. Since I had to bounce around the net combining pieces of information to make this thing operational, I decided to write this post for myself and perhaps the passerby.</p>

<p>Requirements for dataset:</p>

<ul>
<li>Free</li>
<li>Can&rsquo;t be too large</li>
<li>Setup should be easy</li>
</ul>

<p>Thankfully a quick search and I came across the <a href="https://mimic.physionet.org/">MIMIC dataset</a> put together by the MIT Lab for Computational Physiology. This is a deidentified dataset of over 40,000 critical care patients and contains all sorts of information such as lab tests, medications, demographics, etc. It&rsquo;s free, not too large (90GB when all said and done), and can be setup relatively easily thanks to the wonderful support they already provide!</p>

  </figure>



<p>I followed instructions in the documentation to request access by filling out the necessary information and taking the required HIPAA training.</p>

<p><em>Note: I&rsquo;m glad they require the training because eventhough the data is deidentified, I&rsquo;m sure with enough grit something identifiable could be derived from it and it&rsquo;s nice to make sure users are held to a standard.</em></p>

<p>So once I received access it just then became a matter of how I wanted to set up the dataset. The website linked above is very helpful in describing the dataset and providing information on how to download and/or setup a database so it was fairly painless. The repository on <a href="https://github.com/MIT-LCP/mimic-code/">Github</a> has a <code>buildmimic</code> folder with several options baked in. I went with the common Postgres install.</p>

<p><em>Note: instructions are geared toward OSX and assume you have about 100GB of disk space available</em></p>

<p>First things first, make sure you have Postgres installed. This can be checked with a simple <code>which postgres</code> in Terminal. If it comes back with nothing, then we&rsquo;ll have to get Postgres installed. Easiest way to do this, in my opinion, is to use <a href="https://brew.sh/">homebrew</a>. If that&rsquo;s not installed on your computer then I recommend just following along on their website and coming back here.</p>

<p>Assuming <code>brew</code> is installed, then I&rsquo;ve put together a little gist to help out. Feel free to reach out if you have questions and I&rsquo;ll see if I can help.</p>

<script type="application/javascript" src="//gist.github.com/phdjsep/d9b0bc48e6eec78e61bb0fe7da32d534.js"></script>

<p>So after following the above gist, you should have a functional postgres set up. Yay! Let&rsquo;s go ahead and move forward with getting the MIMIC code, data, and subsequently loading it into our local postgres.</p>

<ol>
<li>First we need to create a <code>postgres</code> user.
This will make things easier when loading the MIMIC data. To do so, go to your Terminal and run: <code>/usr/local/opt/postgres/bin/createuser -s postgres</code></li>
<li>Clone the MIMIC repository (assumes <code>git</code> is installed. If not <code>brew install git</code>).
Find a place on your local system that you want to keep the code and in your Terminal run <code>git clone https://github.com/MIT-LCP/mimic-code.git</code>. This will &ldquo;clone&rdquo; the code to your local system so we can leverage the wonderful work the folks at MIT have already done.</li>
<li>Retrieve the data (assumes <code>wget</code> is installed. If not <code>brew install wget</code>).
Find somewhere you&rsquo;ll want to store the data (in gzipped format) and in your Terminal run:
<code>wget --user &lt;USERNAME&gt; --ask-password -A csv.gz -m -p -E -k -K -np -nd https://physionet.org/works/MIMICIIIClinicalDatabase/files/</code></li>
<li>Load the data.
You&rsquo;ll now need to <code>cd</code> into the MIMIC code repository we cloned and specifically into the <code>buildmimic/postgres</code> directory. From there you can run the: <code>make create-user mimic-gz datadir=&quot;/PATH/TO/THE/DATA&quot;</code> command. <em>Note: This will take several hours to run (depending on your system). It&rsquo;s recommended to do this overnight and to use something like <code>caffeine</code> (If not installed: <code>brew cask install caffeine</code>)</em></li>
</ol>

<p>At the end of that script should be a database check and you should be ready to use the database! Feel free to reach out if you have questions and I&rsquo;ll do my best. :)</p>
