## Origin story
I pretty much knew I wanted to be a scientist since the age of 5. The declaration came while in Yosemite. My Mom and her best friend were getting ready for a wedding. I was sitting on the bed intently watching the Discovery Channel when my Mom's friend turned to me and asked, "I have a favor to ask you. Will you be the ring bearer?". After a few seconds of thought, I vehemently declared that I did not want to be a ring bearer and that, "I want to be a scientist!". It was of course explained to me that the role was temporary and I could pursue both, so I graciously accepted the temporary ring bearer role. 😊 Here's the evidence in all its glory...{{< instagram moZnAjTR0d hidecaption >}}
